A simple Flask based webapp that allows users to upload data, train machine learning models on them, and make predictions on test data.

The app is running on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://ml-interface-temp.herokuapp.com).

This project was done as a semester project for the course CS G527 Cloud Computing under the guidance of Prof. Sudeepta Mishra at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.
